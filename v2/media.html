                                                            Blockchain technology first grew popular as the backbone of Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency. After its emergence, people often confused blockchain with
                                                            Bitcoin, rather than seeing it as the technology that created the cryptocurrency. But, soon, the world started seeing it for what it was; a technology that had the potential to
                                                            disrupt the business model of industries across the world.

                                                            banking, finance and insurance industry, with companies incorporating this technology into their daily processes. When the Supreme Court of India in 2020 overturned the ban on
                                                            crypto assets in the country — imposed by the Reserve Bank of India back in 2018 — many industry leaders and startups used this opportunity to venture into the crypto world.

                                                            multiple use cases. According to a report, 56% of Indian industries are inclined to make blockchain a part of their core operations, and it does not just include private players
                                                            but the public sector too, which uses this technology for use cases such as vehicle lifecycle management, electronic health record management, and farm insurance.

                                                            fan or a Zuper fan. What one must primarily do is, download the SportZchain app which is available for both iOS and Android, after the sign-up from google or Facebook, fans must
                                                            use the pre-created ERC20 wallet Or Link existing wallet (Metamask/TrustWallet/Trezor/Others), following which the fan should buy SPN through cryptos like ETH, BNB, USDT, BTC, etc.
                                                            This enables a fan to buy branded sports team tokens with $SPN and one establishes its start in becoming a ZuperFan and reaping financial rewards.

                                                            Recent years have seen cryptocurrency become more prominent in the fintech space as a large number of industries are shifting their focus towards using cryptocurrency in their
                                                            daily operations. The sports industry too is realising the economic benefits of using cryptocurrency, and is looking for ways to involve cryptocurrency in the industry. One of its
                                                            biggest benefits, especially during pandemic times, is retaining and upgrading fan engagement at a global level.

                                                            With the constraints of the pandemic, the sports industry has had to devise strategies to keep the fan base engaged and connected. Sponsorship and commercial deals have led to an
                                                            increased awareness of cryptocurrency and helped boost its popularity to the extent that in the space of a year, 47% of sports fans are familiar with cryptocurrency, with 27%

                                                        <h4>Economic benefits of cryptocurrency in sports</h4>
                                                        <p>
                                                            It is with the irrefutable support of blockchain technology that secure and transparent digital exchanges have been made possible. With the security provided by blockchain,
                                                            cryptocurrency in sports, or our native SportZ Tokens can be used not just by fans, but also by clubs to pay the salaries of players and transfer fees. For instance, Lionel Messi’s
                                                            transfer earlier this year to Ligue 1’s Paris Saint-Germain F.C. included some payment in cryptocurrency. If the world’s best footballer has started this trend, then there is
                                                            little doubt that cryptocurrency will be used a lot more in the future as salaries and transfer fees!
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            These tokens have proven to be the perfect incentive to power the craze by pitching cryptocurrency as a way to increase digital engagement with fans. A fan who has bought a SportZ
                                                            Token of a club they support, turns into an ‘invested fan’. In conduct, SportZ Tokens grant fans the right to vote on club matters, like which songs to play while the team warms
                                                            up, kit designs, training ground names, and picking charity events. Not only do they help increase fan engagement, they also provide the added benefit of helping filter out
                                                            dedicated fans from the general noise found on social media. Cryptocurrency is providing a space where their voices can be heard and they can have some influence over binding and
                                                            non-binding decisions made by the clubs they support.

                                                            In the Indian sports industry, the Pro Kabaddi League has seen four of their teams being proactive in this space: Bengal Warriors, Dabang Delhi, Tamil Thalaivas, and Gurajat Giants
                                                            join the crypto swing. With the SportZ Tokens of these respective teams, fans can be a part of voting polls, chat forums, get VIP rewards, AR-enabled features, and exclusive club
                                                            and sponsor promotions. It comes as no surprise that tokens are gaining popularity and momentum, and are proving to be a powerful tool in enhancing and optimising fan engagement.

                                                            of tangible and intangible items which can be stored on digital wallets, from collectibles to digital sneakers, the market for trading NFTs is huge and can be easily verified.

                                                            Though there may be risks, cryptocurrency provides plenty of opportunities to be the cultural revolution of the 21st century. Having a crypto wallet on a platform will be
                                                            equivalent to holding a visa card. There is no doubt that this exciting confluence holds great promise for the future and is set to revolutionize the fan engagement sphere.

                                                            Legend has it that Kabaddi originated from Tamil Nadu over 4,000 years ago. The state renowned for its intricate temple cravings and exhilarating hill stations is also the home of
                                                            fierce and passionate Kabaddi fans. Emerging from these roots, Tamil Thalaivas, a high-octane and spirited Pro-Kabaddi team, has recently joined SportZchain, an India-based
                                                            blockchain-powered platform establishing an invested fan base for the country’s wide range of sports teams.

                                                            country, but they don’t have a direct say in influencing their favorite sports team. Addressing this need-gap, SportZchain envisions to link the space between fans and their chosen
                                                            sports team through a blockchain-based fan engagement platform.

                                                            favorite sports teams while also gaining monetary benefits and money can’t buy experiences.

                                                            have Tamil Thalaiva on board and look forward to empower fans and take fan engagement to new heights.

                                                            higher level than before. SportZchain has come one step closer to making the value a fan has for their favourite sports go up exponentially.

                                                            While the world of cryptocurrency is immeasurably vast (and still growing!), Sports Tokens or Fan Tokens are an easy and simplified way of increasing fan interaction with sports
                                                            teams. This concept builds on converting a passive fan-based into an invested fan-base by giving them the power to influence binding and non-binding club decisions. Currently,
                                                            SportZchain is focussed on bringing the platform to Indian audiences and soon expects to expand globally — with plans to bring aboard three sports teams in the next year.

                                                            in the decision making process for their favourite sports teams and clubs. From having a right to vote on simple decisions such as jersey colours to crucial decisions such as
                                                            player division and transfers — fans with sports tokens will now be able to engage with their favourite teams like never before.

                                                            sports fans the freedom to interact with the sports teams and get not only financial benefits from it, but also a chance to engage with teams. We seek to change the way sports fans
                                                            interact with their favourite teams and make fans a part of their financial success, thereby closing the gap between fans and teams — making each win even more special.

                                                            Now that we’ve established what tokens and coins are, let’s get to understanding the basic idea behind ‘Fan Tokens’ or ‘Sports Tokens’. These tokens are essentially a form of
                                                            cryptocurrency that allows sports fans to have added perks and gain inner access into the decision making of their favourite sports teams.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            When you own a sports token for a particular team, you have access to various benefits such as having a say in binding and non-binding club decisions, club merchandise discounts,
                                                            ownership of NFTs and financial rewards. What’s more is that these ‘Sports Tokens’ are completely fungible (unlike NFT’s) and can be exchanged in any transaction for products.
                                                            Owning a sports token will get you much more than just a normal membership — wherein you have to periodically re-purchase membership. In case of tokens, fans have access that
                                                            doesn’t expire and isn’t limited to a particular season. What’s more is that when one is an ‘invested fan’, they have rights to influence club decisions, get VIP benefits such as
                                                            merchandise discounts, meet and greets and much more, and also have the chance to get financial incentives as these tokens are tradable.

                                                        <p>
                                                            As a sports fan, I would love to have the chance to be more interactive with my favourite sports teams. To be able to have a say in club decisions that impact the performance of
                                                            the team makes me, the fan, more invested in the sport and also implies that I am now a part of the functioning of the club.

                                                            Cryptocurrency is on every eager investor’s tongue, and one can’t help but wonder how it works. When we speak of cryptocurrency, we essentially speak of ‘tokens’ and ‘coins’ — two
                                                            points of value given to each purchasable item in a blockchain. While the terms ‘coin’ and ‘token’ often go hand in hand, they are two very distinct terms. ‘Coins’, being the most
                                                            well-known mode of cryptocurrency transactions, work on independent blockchains. To break it down, ‘BitCoin’ runs on the Bitcoin blockchain and so on. Just like that, you can tell
                                                            that coins are used directly for transactions, just like regular money. However, tokens run a little differently. While Coins work on independent blockchains, ‘tokens’ are applied
                                                            on already existing blockchains. Tokens, however, come in the form of tradable digital assets.

                                                            Now, before we go any further, I would like for you to sit back and ask yourself one simple question — would you like to have a say in the decisions your favourite sports team
                                                            makes?
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>If you, even for a split second, found yourself wanting to do that, I want you to read on.</p>

                                                            When we tokenise a particular part of an industry, we offer the consumers or fans to participate and interact with the working of that industry. As fans of various sports and
                                                            sports teams, we would love nothing more than to be able to participate in the workings of our favourite teams. From the colour of their new jerseys to player transfers — the idea
                                                            of being able to have the right to vote in the decision-making process of any given sports team will only increase the value a fan gives to their sport — which only makes every
                                                            move made by the team as special as ever.
